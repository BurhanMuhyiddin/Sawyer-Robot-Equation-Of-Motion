# Sawyer-Robot-Equation-Of-Motion
In this project, I have created a script to get the equation of motion of the 7DOF robot manipulator, Sawyer. 
So, the things I have done:
1. Calculate the DH parameter of sawyer robot
2. Calculate the homogenous transforation matrices for each of the link
3. Calculate angular velocity Jacobian
4. Calculate linear velocity Jacobian
5. Calculate Ineertia matrix
6. Calculate Centrifugal and Carriolis terms
7. Calculate Potential Energy for the robot
8. Calculate Kinetic Energy for the robot
9. Calculate Lagrangian Equations of Motions for the robot manipulator
